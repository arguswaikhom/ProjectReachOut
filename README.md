# Android-ProjectReachOut

Project Reachout is an NGO which mainly focuses on upbringing talents and helping a bunch of specially-abled kids to bring joy in their lives to cope up with this world. This NGO has 5 different teams and they organise many events in many schools. 

So, this project is a full stack project (kind of social media) with an Android app which will be powered by a Django backend. Using this app all the people who work for this NGO will be able to share pictures or articles about the events they are organizing, those post can be seen by anyone who uses the app. The higher authority of the NGO such as event managers can create a new event and assign it to the team members of different teams and those team members (event organizers) will get a notification when someone assigns them for an event and they can see more details about the event. An organizer can see a list of events which involved them and they can add or update details about the event such as investment details (when they invested some money for the event). Those details can be seen by the organizers of the event and the higher authorities. 

We build this app to make it easier for them to organise their work for those specially-abled kids and share each other's events experiences. Those post can also be shared with other social media platforms right from our app. There is no account creation activity in the app, it is created by the NGO by using a webpage, not from the application.

It is an incomplete project and we are working so hard to deliver it as soon as possible. Please check the ProjectOverviewFlowchart.pdf file in the Github ProjectReachOut directory (link provided) for better visualization of the app. Thank You.

# TECHNOLOGY UTILIZATION
If we are talking about the technology utilization part, we have used Android as the front end and it’s developed by using Android Studio IDE. For the backend we used Django which is a python based free and open source web framework. We used a SQL database to store all the data related work. We use many of Google's Android APIs and other third parties libraries.

# INSPIRATION
One thing that we have been taught since childhood is about good deeds and according to us nothing could be better than helping a bunch of specially-abled kids and to bring joy in their lives. Our project is thus for an NGO named Project Reachout who mainly focuses on upbringing their talents and helping them to cope up with this world. Being specially abled is not to be scared of as it’s only 10 in a million who gets an opportunity to be the special kids of god. With this thought, we started this project in managing the database of this NGO and in helping them in a small way to reach the kids better.

# OUTCOME
In our project, we are making a full-fledged application for their utilization. It has different sections to be accessed by different sets of volunteers. The core mainly is divided into 5 with having 5 more volunteers under them. So for example, if it’s the event management sector, only they can access that part and edit it accordingly by logging in. Some features can be accessed by the viewers too to know the gist about the NGO. Other features include the attendance marking in the app only when they go to the school the document you are making can you mention some details about the account creation. It even includes notification sending to all the volunteers thus restricting the usage but overall managing their respective sectors making the work simpler for them.
